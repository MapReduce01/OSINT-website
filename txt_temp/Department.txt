### Additional Information:
Each of these departments can have multiple teams working under them, focusing on specific projects or technologies. Google has a hierarchical structure, but it often emphasizes collaboration and cross-departmental projects.

Google also invests heavily into R&D, often operating “moonshot” projects through its X, the innovation lab.

Overall, Google’s expansive structure reflects its priority on innovation, user experience, and maintaining its leading edge in various tech fields. For the most current information about its organizational structure, I recommend checking Google or Alphabet’s official corporate communications or their annual reports.
