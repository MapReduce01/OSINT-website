IntelliScout

Our project focuses on using LLM to help our Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) to collect valuable information about organizations in a structured manner from legal and public sources
Traditional OSINT tools  often rely on complex decision-making algorithms, mainly used by cybersecurity experts and data analists. 
However, In recent years, the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), like the GPT series, can change OSINT toolsã€‚ With the power of LLMs, these tools can become more user-friendly. LLMs' advanced understanding allow us to turn traditional web crawlers into a security intelligence, enabling every user to access.


First, the IntelliScout use LLM to analyze and filter the infos.
Second, IntelliScout Designed with a user-friendly and intuitive GUI, our tool simplifies complex processes, making it accessible to everyday users.
